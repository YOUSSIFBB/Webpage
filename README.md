Iv'e built a travel website using HTML and CSS that showcases diffrent countires that people could travel to. Each country has a small descroption for what it provides in terms of flight prices, popular destinations, and many more. The website uses a API that i created, the data is stored in a JSON file format that I uploaded to the cloud. From there, I used javaScript to display the content on the webpage using fetch API.
